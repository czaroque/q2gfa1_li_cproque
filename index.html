        <p>Childhope Philippines Foundation, Inc. or Childhope Philippines is a non-government organization or NGO for children in the Philippines. We work to promote the welfare, uphold, and protect children’s rights, particularly children in street situations. Childhope Philippines traces its history back when Childhope International was founded in 1986. Individuals from children’s agencies saw the need to address the plight of children needing protection, especially those living in the streets. In 1989, a regional office for Asia was established in Manila after the First Regional Conference of Street Children in Asia. This forum facilitated networking and collaboration among agencies working for street children in the Asian region. <br> <br>
            After Childhope International ceased its operations in 1989, Childhope (Asia office) still continued its operations. Projects included outreach, protection, and education on the streets program, and technical assistance to other Asian nations who wanted to address the problem in their country.</p>
